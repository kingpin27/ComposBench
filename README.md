# ComposBench
The all-in-one workbench for Composed Image Retrieval. Benchmark SOTA models, evaluate new methods, and visualize failure cases with an integrated UI.

## Features
1. Frontend to qualitatively evaluate algorithms
2. backend library to integrate with custom algorithms
3. Implementation of most of the CIR algorithms
